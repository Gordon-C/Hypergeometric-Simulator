Hypergeometric-Simulator
=

This is a desktop application meant to aesthetically represent pulling marbles from a bag without replacement (such random sampling follows the hypergeometric distribution, hence the application's name).

Installation and Usage
-

### Windows
A windows installer can be downloaded [here](http://tinyurl.com/hypergeosim).

### Other
Currently, only a windows installer exists. However, the program can be crudely invoked from the command line on any system with python by running the `hypergeom.py` file. 

**NOTE:** Python version must be 2.x due to GUI module naming inconsistencies 

Future Improvements
-
* Add threading to handle large inputs without noticeable lag
* Create installers for other operating systems
* Add dynamic scaling to trial displays screen
