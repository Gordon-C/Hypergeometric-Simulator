Hypergeometric-Simulator
========================

This is a desktop application meant to aesthetically represent pulling marbles from a bag without replacement (such random sampling follows the hypergeometric distribution, hence the application's name). Currently, only a windows installer exists, and can be downloaded [here](http://tinyurl.com/hypergeosim).

_Future _Improvements
* Add threading to handle large inputs without noticeable lag
* Create installers for other operating systems
* Add dynamic scaling to trial displays screen
